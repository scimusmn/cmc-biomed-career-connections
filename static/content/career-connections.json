      "story": "Blood is considered to be a drug and we're regulated by the FDA. My job is to make sure that the blood that we collect, process and distribute is safe for the donors and for the recipients. I think of blood donation as a donor giving freely of their life essence and creating a link with someone in need, which is inspiring!",

      "story": "Working in the hospital as a patient transporter gave me a chance to see lots of careers. I knew I wanted to be hands-on with patients. So, I went to Cincinnati State, got my Associate’s degree and passed my medical boards in respiratory therapy. That opened new opportunities for me at the hospital and eventually got me to the sidelines at Cincinnati Bengals games, where I’m part of the emergency action plan to support players. On my best days, I get to help people breathe better and get back to their families.",

My work focuses on those behaviors. How do we optimize and make it easy for people to do what they need to do to care for their conditions and themselves?",

I get to know some of the regular donors and learn about their families — I look forward to asking them about how they are doing and to thanking them for giving. These volunteers help the community and save lives, and I love playing a role in that.",

I may not be able to take an x-ray in a textbook way, because it would make the patient uncomfortable, but I always find a way to get the doctors the information they need without harming the patient or making them feel worse.",

Without your muscles working together, you would not be able to do things like sit and stand, run and jump. Your muscles are the dynamic part of you. They help you be a person. They’re what makes you fun!",

That blend of bones and nerves hooked me as a medical student. I aim to keep people as active as they can be — if you've got a bad spine, it's hard to do anything well.",
